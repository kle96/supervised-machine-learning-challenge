Compare the Logistic Regression and Random Forest models towards predicting loan status data based on:
- loan size
- interest rate
- borrower income
- debt to income
- number of accounts
- derogatory marks
- total debt

As a result, it was found that the Random Forest Classification model performed better than the Logistic Regression with a score of 100% accuracy.
